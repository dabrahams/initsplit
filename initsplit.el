;;; Commentary:

;; This file allows you to split Emacs customizations (set via M-x
;; customize) into different files, based on the names of the
;; variables.  It uses a regexp to match against each face and
;; variable name, and associates with a file that the variable should
;; be stored in.

;; To use it, just load the file in your .emacs:
;;
;;   (load "initsplit")
;;
;; If you want configuration files byte-compiled, add this after it:
;;
;;   (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'initsplit-byte-compile-files t)

;; Note that that you *must* load each file that contains your various
;; customizations from your .emacs.  Otherwise, the variables won't
;; all be set, and the next time you use the customize interface, it
;; will delete the settings in those other files.

;; Then, customize the variable `initsplit-customizations-alist', to
;; associate various configuration names with their respective
;; initialization files.

;; I find this module most useful for splitting up Gnus and Viper
;; customizations.
